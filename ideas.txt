I'll have a video running in the background of my portfolio webpage. About what idk /shrug

The whole design should be focussed on something about me that I like. (Easter eggs)
Genre options so far would be Games | Anime | Sport


Then we'll have About | Projects | (maybe a settings page)
The whole thing should be setup with react and js

I think I only do two pages but I'mma add an option so u can just swipe left and right


Add a journey and a hit me up option
Also maybe on the home page make something so the page doesen't scroll down the text just appears and disappears when u scroll

I can do the header similar to this site:
