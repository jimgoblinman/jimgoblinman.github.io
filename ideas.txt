I'll have a video running in the background of my portfolio webpage. About what idk /shrug

The whole design should be focussed on something about me that I like. (Easter eggs)
Genre options so far would be Games | Anime | Sport


Then we'll have About | Projects | (maybe a settings page)
The whole thing should be setup with react and js

I think I only do two pages but I'mma add an option so u can just swipe left and right


Add a journey and a hit me up option
Also maybe on the home page make something so the page doesen't scroll down the text just appears and disappears when u scroll

I can do the header similar to this site:
https://coryhughart.com/



Get the page more or less finished using modals and then try to add smooth scroll the the website to finish it. 


Home
About
Journey
Add a sliderview on the right side of the page and on the left I'll have a picture that will change according to where I'm located on my journey. (E.g a picture of my school building or smth.)
Hit Me Up
Projects
Footer
Add a display flex and add social links | contact | copyright

Maybe put longer texts into text files and just import them
